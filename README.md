# User Management Table with React and TypeScript

This project is a React-based user management table application that allows users to view, filter, sort, and manage a list of users. It leverages TypeScript for type safety and Material-UI (MUI) for styling and UI components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance and minifies the output. The filenames include hashes to ensure proper caching.

- **`npm run eject`**: **Note: this is a one-way operation.** This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. This gives you full control over the configuration but is not recommended unless necessary.

## Project Overview

The project implements a user management table with the following key features:

1. **Fetching Data**: Retrieves user data from a backend service.
2. **Filtering**: Allows users to filter the list of users based on various criteria.
3. **Sorting**: Enables sorting of user data by different fields.
4. **Displaying Data**: Presents the data in a table format with appropriate feedback for loading and no data states.

## Key Components

### `UserTable`

- **Purpose**: Displays a table of users with filtering and sorting capabilities.
- **Features**:

  - Fetches user data using Redux.
  - Supports sorting by fields (name, username, email, phone).
  - Filters users based on input criteria.
  - Displays loading spinner or a message when no users are found.

- **Implementation**:
  - Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and Redux for state management.
  - Handles filter and sort changes with appropriate event handlers.

### `UserFilters`

- **Purpose**: Provides input fields for filtering the user list.
- **Features**:

  - Renders dynamic text fields for different filter criteria.
  - Uses TypeScript for type safety.

- **Implementation**:
  - Utilizes a configuration array for dynamic rendering of filter fields.
  - Passes filter changes to the parent component.

### `ProjectSummaryModal`

- **Purpose**: Displays a modal with a summary of the project.
- **Features**:

  - Shows detailed information about the project in a modal dialog.
  - Contains a close button to dismiss the modal.

- **Implementation**:
  - Uses Material-UI's `Dialog` component for the modal functionality.
  - Styles and structures the modal content for readability.

## Styling

The project uses Material-UI for UI components and custom styles defined in `styles.ts`. Key components include `Table`, `TableHead`, `TableBody`, `TextField`, and `CircularProgress`.

## TypeScript Usage

TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety. Types are defined for props, state, and filter fields, and TypeScript errors are addressed to maintain code quality.

## Error Handling and UX

- **Loading State**: Displays a `CircularProgress` spinner while data is being fetched.
- **No Data Message**: Shows a message when no users match the filter criteria to inform users of the empty state.

## Project Summary

This project showcases a comprehensive user management system with features for filtering, sorting, and dynamic rendering. It utilizes modern React features, TypeScript for type safety, and Material-UI for a polished user interface. The primary challenge was ensuring a smooth user experience while handling data efficiently.
